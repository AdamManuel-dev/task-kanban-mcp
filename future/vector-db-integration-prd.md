# Product Requirements Document: Vector Database Integration for task-kanban-mcp

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Product:** task-kanban-mcp Vector Intelligence Enhancement  
**Author:** Product Management Team

## 1. Executive Summary

This PRD defines the integration of vector database capabilities into the existing task-kanban-mcp system to create an intelligent, context-aware project management environment for individual developers using Claude Code and other AI assistants. The enhancement will enable semantic search, pattern recognition, and intelligent task management through vector embeddings, transforming the system from a simple task tracker into an adaptive development partner that learns from project history and provides contextual assistance.

The integration will maintain backward compatibility with the existing SQLite-based system while adding a vector database layer that captures semantic meaning across all project artifacts, enabling natural language queries, intelligent task routing, and predictive analytics.

## 2. Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
- **Limited Search Capabilities**: Current keyword-based search misses semantically related content
- **Manual Pattern Recognition**: Developers must manually identify and apply past solutions
- **Context Loss**: Project knowledge is fragmented across tasks, notes, and code without semantic connections
- **Inefficient Information Retrieval**: Finding relevant past implementations requires exact keyword matches
- **No Learning Capability**: System doesn't improve or adapt based on developer patterns

### Impact
- Developers spend 70-80% more time searching for information than necessary
- 20-30% error rate in task estimation due to lack of historical pattern analysis
- Repeated mistakes and missed optimization opportunities
- Lost productivity from context switching and manual pattern matching

## 3. Goals & Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Enable Semantic Search**: Allow natural language queries across all project artifacts
2. **Implement Pattern Learning**: Automatically identify and apply successful project patterns
3. **Provide Contextual Intelligence**: Surface relevant information proactively during development
4. **Improve Task Estimation**: Achieve 93% accuracy in story point estimation through historical analysis

### Measurable Objectives
- Reduce information retrieval time by 70-80%
- Improve task estimation accuracy to >90%
- Decrease task planning time by 60-70% for recurring project types
- Achieve <100ms semantic search response time
- Maintain 100% backward compatibility with existing system

### Success Criteria
- 15-40% overall productivity improvement
- 49-67% improvement in relevant information retrieval
- Zero data loss during migration
- Seamless integration with existing Claude Code workflows

## 4. User Personas

### Primary: Solo Developer with AI Assistant
- **Background**: Individual developer using Claude Code for daily development
- **Needs**: Quick access to past solutions, pattern recognition, contextual assistance
- **Pain Points**: Repetitive work, lost context, manual search through project history
- **Technical Skills**: Comfortable with CLI, Docker, and modern development tools
- **Usage Pattern**: 8-10 hours daily, primarily through Claude Code MCP integration

### Secondary: AI Coding Assistant (Claude Code)
- **Background**: AI agent providing coding assistance through MCP protocol
- **Needs**: Semantic understanding of project context, access to relevant patterns
- **Pain Points**: Limited context window, no persistent memory of past solutions
- **Constraints**: MCP protocol limitations, need for structured data access

## 5. User Stories

### Semantic Search & Retrieval
1. **As a developer**, I want to search for "authentication implementations" and find all related code, documentation, and patterns regardless of specific terminology used.

2. **As Claude Code**, I want to understand the semantic context of the current task to provide more relevant suggestions based on similar past work.

3. **As a developer**, I want to ask "how did I handle JWT refresh tokens?" and receive all relevant implementations across projects.

### Pattern Recognition & Learning
4. **As a developer**, I want the system to recognize when I'm implementing a feature similar to past work and suggest proven approaches.

5. **As Claude Code**, I want to access embeddings of successful past implementations when generating new code.

6. **As a developer**, I want automatic task decomposition based on how similar features were broken down previously.

### Contextual Intelligence
7. **As a developer**, I want relevant documentation and code examples to surface automatically while working on related tasks.

8. **As Claude Code**, I want to retrieve contextually relevant information without explicit queries when assisting with development.

9. **As a developer**, I want the system to predict task dependencies based on semantic similarity to past projects.

### Task Management Enhancement
10. **As a developer**, I want duplicate task detection based on semantic similarity, not just keyword matching.

11. **As a developer**, I want intelligent task routing that suggests appropriate kanban columns based on task content and historical patterns.

12. **As Claude Code**, I want to estimate task complexity by comparing against semantically similar completed tasks.

### Knowledge Management
13. **As a developer**, I want all my project artifacts (code, docs, tasks) unified in a searchable semantic space.

14. **As a developer**, I want to discover connections between seemingly unrelated project components through semantic analysis.

15. **As Claude Code**, I want to maintain awareness of the entire codebase through vector embeddings without loading all files.

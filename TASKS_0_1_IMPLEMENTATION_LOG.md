## üéØ PRIORITY TASKS IDENTIFIED

### ‚úÖ HIGH PRIORITY - COMPLETED

1. **~~Fix remaining TypeScript bracket notation errors~~** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** (TASKS_0.md)
   - **Issue**: ~20 TS4111 errors requiring bracket notation for index signatures
   - **Files**: context.ts, export.ts, realtime.ts, logger.ts
   - **Solution**: Created proper interfaces where possible, used bracket notation for Record types
   - **Result**: 0 TS4111 errors remaining

### MEDIUM PRIORITY

2. **Enhance AI prioritization algorithm** (TASKS_1.md)
   - **Current**: Basic priority scoring with due dates and dependencies
   - **Missing**: ML pattern recognition, user preference learning, git integration
   - **Impact**: Better task recommendations for users
   - **Effort**: 1-2 weeks

### LOW PRIORITY

3. **Complete code quality improvements** (TASKS_1.md)
   - **Remaining**: Minor ESLint style issues (camelCase, template strings)
   - **Impact**: Code consistency and maintainability
   - **Effort**: 2-3 hours

## üõ†Ô∏è IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Today)

1. Fix TypeScript bracket notation errors using automated ESLint fixes
2. Verify build passes without errors
3. Run full test suite to ensure no regressions

### Phase 2: AI Enhancement (Next Sprint)

1. Research ML libraries for task prioritization
2. Design user behavior tracking system
3. Implement git integration for project context
4. Create learning algorithm for user preferences

### Phase 3: Polish (Ongoing)

1. Address remaining ESLint style issues
2. Improve code documentation
3. Performance optimization opportunities

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED ACHIEVEMENTS

### TASKS_0.md Achievements

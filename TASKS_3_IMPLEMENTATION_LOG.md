## üìã Immediate Action Plan

Based on TASKS_3.md analysis, I'll prioritize:

1. **Code Quality Issues First** (P1 - Blocking)
   - ESLint issues that affect code quality
   - Performance optimizations that impact user experience

2. **Documentation** (P2 - High Value)
   - API documentation for new features
   - Developer guides for contribution

3. **Analytics Foundation** (P3 - Medium Term)
   - Basic usage tracking
   - Performance monitoring

4. **Advanced Features** (P4 - Long Term)
   - Enhanced UX features
   - Integration capabilities

## üéØ Next Steps

Starting with highest priority ESLint issues that are currently blocking development workflow.

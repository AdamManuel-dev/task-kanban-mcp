## Summary

- **Total Packages**: 64
- **Packages with Types**: 30
- **Packages Needing Types**: 6
- **Outdated @types Packages**: 5

## Recommendations

1. Update 13 outdated @types packages: bcrypt, better-sqlite3, compression, cors, dompurify, express, inquirer, jest, jsdom, jsonwebtoken, node-cron, uuid, ws
2. Install missing @types packages: blessed-contrib, cli-table3, enquirer, ink-testing-library, ink, listr2
3. Create ambient declarations for: blessed-contrib, cli-table3, enquirer, ink-testing-library, ink, listr2
4. Consider updating jsonwebtoken for better TypeScript support

## Action Items

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)

1. **Update Outdated @types Packages**
   ```bash
   npm update @types/bcrypt @types/express @types/jest @types/node @types/uuid
   ```

2. **Install Missing @types Packages**
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev @types/blessed-contrib @types/cli-table3 @types/listr2
   ```

3. **Create Ambient Declarations**
   Create `src/types/ambient.d.ts` for packages without type definitions.

### Medium Priority Actions

1. **Contribute to DefinitelyTyped**
   Consider contributing type definitions for packages without @types.

2. **Update jsonwebtoken**
   ```bash
   npm update jsonwebtoken
   ```

### Long-term Actions

1. **Regular Type Audits**
   Run this audit script monthly to track type coverage.

2. **Type Definition Maintenance**
   Keep @types packages updated and monitor for new type definitions.

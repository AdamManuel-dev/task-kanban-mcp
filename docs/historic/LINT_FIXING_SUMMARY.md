## Remaining Issues

### High Priority
1. **CLI Commands**: Several files still have complex type issues and API request signature mismatches
2. **Services**: BackupService has remaining type issues and bracket notation problems
3. **Routes**: Backup routes have complex type issues and method signature problems
4. **Config**: ConfigManager has readonly property assignment issues
5. **WebSocket**: Some files have remaining type issues and readonly property problems

### Medium Priority
1. **Utils**: Some utility files have remaining type safety issues
2. **Middleware**: Some middleware files may have remaining issues
3. **Tests**: Test files have import path and syntax issues

### Low Priority
1. **Documentation**: Some documentation files may have minor formatting issues
2. **Configuration**: Some config files may have minor issues

## Next Steps
1. Continue with remaining CLI command files that have simpler issues
2. Focus on services directory for type safety improvements
3. Address remaining routes with complex type issues
4. Fix test files with import path issues
5. Address any remaining utility and middleware issues
6. Complete WebSocket file fixes

## Challenges Encountered
1. **Record Type Properties**: Many files use `Record<string, unknown>` which requires bracket notation for property access, causing conflicts with dot-notation lint rule
2. **Any Type Assertions**: Complex type hierarchies require `any` assertions that trigger lint warnings
3. **Function Definition Order**: Some files have functions used before they're defined
4. **API Method Signatures**: Inconsistent API client method signatures across different files
5. **Import Path Issues**: Some files have incorrect import paths that need to be resolved
6. **Readonly Properties**: Some classes have readonly properties that can't be reassigned
7. **Complex Type Guards**: Some type checking logic is complex and triggers unsafe access warnings
8. **WebSocket Type Issues**: Complex message type hierarchies require careful type handling

## Files Successfully Fixed (38 total)

## Current Focus
Continuing to systematically address remaining lint issues, prioritizing simpler fixes that can be completed quickly while avoiding complex type issues that require deeper refactoring. Significant progress has been made with a reduction of over 600 errors from the initial count.

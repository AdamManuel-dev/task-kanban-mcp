# Listr Integration Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **TaskRunner Class** (`src/cli/utils/task-runner.ts`)
- Generic task execution framework using Listr2
- Support for concurrent and sequential task execution
- Task grouping with visual hierarchy
- Progress tracking for bulk operations
- Retry logic for failed tasks
- Dependency resolution for complex task graphs

### 2. **TodoProcessor Class** (`src/cli/utils/todo-processor.ts`)
- Parses TODO.md files and extracts task information
- Groups tasks by phase for organized execution
- Handles task dependencies automatically
- Generates implementation reports
- Supports dry-run mode for testing
- Visual feedback during processing

### 3. **CLI Command** (`src/cli/commands/process-todos.ts`)
- New `process-todos` command for the CLI
- Options for concurrent execution, grouping, and reporting
- Integrated into main CLI application

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Process TODOs with visual feedback
kanban process-todos cli-upgrade/TODO.md

# Group by phase and run concurrently
kanban process-todos cli-upgrade/TODO.md --group-by-phase --concurrent

# Generate report and use dry-run mode
kanban process-todos cli-upgrade/TODO.md --generate-report --dry-run
```

### Demo Script
```bash
# Run the demo to see it in action
tsx cli-upgrade/demo-todo-processor.ts
```

## Visual Output Example

When running, you'll see:
```
✔ Phase 1: Project Setup [15/15]
  ✔ TASK-001: Verify Node.js compatibility
  ✔ TASK-002: Create backup
  ...
⠼ Phase 2: Core Utilities [3/8]
  ✔ TASK-016: SpinnerManager
  ⠼ TASK-020: Formatter utilities
  ⠼ TASK-024: Validators
  ⠼ TASK-031: Task prompts
```

## Benefits

1. **Visual Progress Tracking**: See exactly what's being worked on
2. **Concurrent Execution**: Process independent tasks simultaneously
3. **Dependency Management**: Automatically handles task ordering
4. **Error Recovery**: Built-in retry logic and error handling
5. **Report Generation**: Creates summary reports of implementation progress

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time log streaming for active tasks
- Task dependency visualization
- Integration with git for automatic commits
- Time tracking and estimation accuracy
- Machine learning for better task size predictions

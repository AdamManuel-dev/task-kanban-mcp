## Dependencies Identified

### Git Integration Chain (Tasks 1-4)

- Task 1 (Git detection) → Task 2 (Branch parsing) → Task 3 (Board selection) → Task 4 (Configuration)
- All tasks in this chain are interdependent and should be completed sequentially

### Backup Enhancement Chain (Tasks 5-7)

- Independent tasks that can be worked on in parallel
- Task 7 (verification) depends on Tasks 5-6 being complete

### API Enhancement Dependencies

- Subtask APIs (Task 13) needed before WebSocket events (Task 15)
- Dependency APIs (Task 14) needed for critical path (Task 10)

## Architecture Impact Analysis

### High Impact Changes

- Git integration will require new CLI configuration system
- Context-aware board selection affects all CLI commands
- WebSocket enhancements may require protocol changes

### Breaking Changes Potential

- Board mapping configuration may change existing CLI behavior
- API endpoint additions are additive (non-breaking)

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Git Integration Foundation (Week 1)

- Start with git detection as it's the foundation
- Build branch parsing on top of detection
- Implement board selection using parsed data
- Add configuration system last

### Phase 2: Parallel Development (Weeks 2-3)

- Backup enhancements (independent)
- Task management features (some dependencies on git integration)
- API endpoints (independent)

### Phase 3: Cross-Platform & Testing (Weeks 4-5)

- Installation improvements
- Testing infrastructure
- Documentation validation

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

- Git integration complexity across different Git setups
- Cross-platform script compatibility issues
- WebSocket performance impact with new features

### Mitigation Strategies

- Incremental implementation with extensive testing
- Platform-specific testing in CI/CD
- Performance monitoring for WebSocket changes

## Notes

- All new features should follow existing code patterns
- TypeScript safety is priority - no `any` types
- Comprehensive testing required for each feature
- Documentation updates required for public APIs

# TypeScript Error Fixing Log

## Initial State
- **Date**: 2025-07-27
- **Total Errors**: 160 (all in transactions.ts)
- **TypeScript Version**: 5.8.3

## Error Analysis
Initial errors were all in transactions.ts due to nested comments in JSDoc examples.
After fixing that, 644 new errors were revealed across the codebase.

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: transactions.ts - JSDoc Code Block Issues
- **Issue**: Nested `/* ... */` comments in JSDoc examples were terminating the JSDoc block prematurely
- **Solution**: Changed to `// ...` comments
- **Result**: Fixed all 160 errors in transactions.ts, revealing 644 additional errors in other files

### Fix 2: context.ts - TS4111 Property Access from Index Signature
- **Issue**: Properties from index signatures must be accessed with bracket notation when `noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature` is true
- **Solution**: Changed `taskContext.property` to `taskContext['property']` for all affected properties
- **Result**: Fixed ~10 TS4111 errors

### Fix 3: dashboard-manager.ts - Multiple Issues
- **Issue 1**: `contrib.grid` used with `new` operator when it's a function
- **Solution**: Changed `new contrib.grid()` to `contrib.grid()`
- **Issue 2**: Static methods trying to access instance properties
- **Solution**: Changed static methods to instance methods (clearWidgets, addHeader, addFooter, showDebugOverlay, hideDebugOverlay)
- **Issue 3**: `currentLayout` declared as readonly but being assigned
- **Solution**: Removed readonly modifier
- **Issue 4**: Missing types for `log` and `sparkline` widgets
- **Solution**: Added type definitions to ambient.d.ts
- **Issue 5**: Commented out properties being referenced
- **Solution**: Uncommented focusedWidget, isFullscreen, and debugMode properties
- **Result**: Fixed ~40 errors

### Fix 4: database/integrity.ts - TS4111 Index Signature Access
- **Issue**: Properties on objects with index signatures must use bracket notation
- **Solution**: Changed all `metadata.property` and similar patterns to bracket notation
- **Result**: Fixed 31 TS4111 errors

### Fix 5: CLI Commands - TS4111 Index Signature Access
- **Issue**: Same TS4111 errors in search.ts and notes.ts
- **Solution**: Changed dot notation to bracket notation for params and other objects with index signatures
- **Result**: Fixed 30 TS4111 errors (15 in search.ts, 15 in notes.ts)

### Fix 6: tasks.ts - Multiple Issues
- **Issue 1**: TS2339 - Property 'error' does not exist on narrowed type
- **Solution**: Fixed type narrowing issue by handling response types correctly
- **Issue 2**: Wrong return type for createTask causing type narrowing issues
- **Solution**: Changed return type from TaskResponse to AnyApiResponse
- **Issue 3**: Default vs named export for TaskList component
- **Solution**: Changed import to use default export
- **Issue 4**: Task type not exported from cli/types
- **Solution**: Import Task from parent types module
- **Issue 5**: More TS4111 errors on params and taskData objects
- **Solution**: Changed all to bracket notation
- **Result**: Fixed ~12 errors

**Current Status**: 541 errors remaining (down from 644)

## Summary So Far
- Fixed 103 TypeScript errors (16% reduction)
- Main issues addressed:
  - JSDoc nested comments breaking TypeScript parser
  - Index signature property access requiring bracket notation
  - Static vs instance method confusion
  - Type narrowing issues with API responses
  - Import/export mismatches

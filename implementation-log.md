## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Type Audit and Analysis ✓ COMPLETED
- [x] Search for all `any` types in the codebase
  - Found 313 instances across 52 files
  - Top offenders: transactions.ts (22), errors.ts (20), mcp/tools.ts (20)
  - Common patterns: type assertions (42), Promise<any> (22), Record<string, any> (18)
- [x] Identify type assertions that can be replaced with type guards
  - Found 59 files with type assertions
  - High risk: External data casting, error handling, WebSocket payloads
  - Identified 15+ high-risk instances needing type guards
- [x] List all functions missing explicit return types
  - Found ~1420 functions (includes false positives from regex)
  - Majority are class methods in service layer
  - Top files: TagService (75), TaskService (63), CLI client (51)
- [x] Analyze current ID type usage
  - Currently using primitive string/number types for IDs
  - No branded types implemented yet

### Phase 2: Type Coverage Implementation ⏳ IN PROGRESS
- [ ] Replace `any` types with proper types
- [x] Implement type guards ✓
  - Created comprehensive type guards in src/utils/typeGuards.ts
  - Includes guards for errors, records, arrays, API responses, WebSocket messages
  - Added utility functions like getErrorMessage and assertType
- [ ] Add return types to functions
- [x] Create branded types for IDs ✓
  - Implemented in src/types/branded.ts
  - Created branded types for all entity IDs (TaskId, BoardId, etc.)
  - Added constructors and type guards for each branded type
  - Includes safe constructors that return null instead of throwing
- [x] Create external data validation utilities ✓
  - Implemented in src/utils/externalDataValidation.ts
  - Zod-based schemas for API responses, query params, WebSocket messages
  - Type-safe fetch wrapper and response handlers
  - Environment variable validation

### Phase 3: Database Type Safety ⏳ IN PROGRESS
- [ ] Evaluate Kysely as a query builder
- [x] Implement runtime validation ✓
  - Created comprehensive database validation schemas in src/utils/databaseValidation.ts
  - Zod schemas for all database entities with SQLite type conversions
  - Validators handle SQLite boolean (0/1) and date conversions
  - Batch validation support for large datasets
- [ ] Create type-safe migration system
- [ ] Implement SQL query templates

## Notes
- TypeScript strict mode is enabled
- Current errors: 3 (related to exactOptionalPropertyTypes)
- ESLint shows 3159 errors, many related to type safety

## Analysis Summary

### Key Findings from Phase 1 Analysis:

1. **`any` Type Usage (313 instances)**
   - Concentrated in error handling, MCP tools, and transaction utilities
   - Many instances could be replaced with generics or specific types
   - Record<string, any> usage indicates need for better interface definitions

2. **Type Assertions (59 files affected)**
   - High-risk areas: External API responses, WebSocket payloads, query parameters
   - Error handling assumes caught values are Error instances
   - Many `as any` casts bypass type safety entirely

3. **Missing Return Types (~1420 functions)**
   - Service layer methods are the biggest offenders
   - Async functions missing explicit Promise<T> types
   - Would benefit from ESLint rule enforcement

4. **ID Type Safety**
   - Currently using primitive types (string/number)
   - No branded types or nominal typing
   - Risk of mixing different ID types

### Priority Implementation Order:
1. Create type guards for high-risk assertions (external data) ✓
2. Implement branded types for IDs ✓
3. Replace critical `any` types in error handling and MCP tools ✓ (partially)
4. Add return types to service layer methods
5. Implement database type safety with runtime validation ✓ (partially)

## Implementation Summary (2025-07-27)

### Completed Today:
1. **Type Guards Utility** (`src/utils/typeGuards.ts`)
   - Comprehensive type guards for runtime checking
   - Guards for errors, records, arrays, API responses, WebSocket messages
   - Helper functions for safe type narrowing

2. **Branded Types** (`src/types/branded.ts`)
   - Nominal typing for all entity IDs (TaskId, BoardId, etc.)
   - Type-safe constructors with validation
   - Type guards and safe constructors for each branded type

3. **External Data Validation** (`src/utils/externalDataValidation.ts`)
   - Zod-based validation schemas for API/WebSocket data
   - Type-safe fetch wrapper and response handlers
   - Query parameter validation with proper typing
   - Environment variable validation

4. **Improved Error Handling** (`src/utils/errors-improved.ts`)
   - Replaced all `any` types with proper `ErrorDetails` type
   - Type-safe error factory functions
   - Improved error context and serialization

5. **Type-Safe Transactions** (`src/utils/transactions-improved.ts`)
   - Removed `any` types from transaction management
   - Type-safe callbacks and rollback actions
   - Better error handling with type guards

6. **Database Validation** (`src/utils/databaseValidation.ts`)
   - Runtime validation schemas for all database entities
   - SQLite type conversion (boolean 0/1, dates)
   - Batch validation support
   - Pre-configured validators for common queries

### Next Steps:
1. **Apply the new utilities to existing code**
   - Replace existing error handling with improved version
   - Update services to use branded types
   - Add database validation to query results

2. **Add return types to service methods**
   - Focus on TaskService, TagService, BoardService
   - Add explicit Promise<T> return types

3. **Replace remaining `any` types**
   - MCP tools implementation
   - CLI client methods
   - Middleware functions

4. **Create tests for type utilities**
   - Unit tests for type guards
   - Tests for branded type constructors
   - Validation schema tests

5. **Evaluate Kysely for query building**
   - Research Kysely's TypeScript support
   - Compare with current approach
   - Create proof of concept if beneficial

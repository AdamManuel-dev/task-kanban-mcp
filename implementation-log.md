## Notes
- TypeScript strict mode is enabled
- Current errors: 3 (related to exactOptionalPropertyTypes)
- ESLint shows 3159 errors, many related to type safety

## Analysis Summary

### Key Findings from Phase 1 Analysis:

1. **`any` Type Usage (313 instances)**
   - Concentrated in error handling, MCP tools, and transaction utilities
   - Many instances could be replaced with generics or specific types
   - Record<string, any> usage indicates need for better interface definitions

2. **Type Assertions (59 files affected)**
   - High-risk areas: External API responses, WebSocket payloads, query parameters
   - Error handling assumes caught values are Error instances
   - Many `as any` casts bypass type safety entirely

3. **Missing Return Types (~1420 functions)**
   - Service layer methods are the biggest offenders
   - Async functions missing explicit Promise<T> types
   - Would benefit from ESLint rule enforcement

4. **ID Type Safety**
   - Currently using primitive types (string/number)
   - No branded types or nominal typing
   - Risk of mixing different ID types

### Priority Implementation Order:
1. Create type guards for high-risk assertions (external data) ✓
2. Implement branded types for IDs ✓
3. Replace critical `any` types in error handling and MCP tools ✓ (partially)
4. Add return types to service layer methods
5. Implement database type safety with runtime validation ✓ (partially)

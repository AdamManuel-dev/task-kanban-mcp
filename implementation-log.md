## Notes
- TypeScript strict mode is enabled
- Current errors: 3 (related to exactOptionalPropertyTypes)
- ESLint shows 3159 errors, many related to type safety

## Analysis Summary

### Key Findings from Phase 1 Analysis:

1. **`any` Type Usage (313 instances)**
   - Concentrated in error handling, MCP tools, and transaction utilities
   - Many instances could be replaced with generics or specific types
   - Record<string, any> usage indicates need for better interface definitions

2. **Type Assertions (59 files affected)**
   - High-risk areas: External API responses, WebSocket payloads, query parameters
   - Error handling assumes caught values are Error instances
   - Many `as any` casts bypass type safety entirely

3. **Missing Return Types (~1420 functions)**
   - Service layer methods are the biggest offenders
   - Async functions missing explicit Promise<T> types
   - Would benefit from ESLint rule enforcement

4. **ID Type Safety**
   - Currently using primitive types (string/number)
   - No branded types or nominal typing
   - Risk of mixing different ID types

### Priority Implementation Order:
1. Create type guards for high-risk assertions (external data) ✓
2. Implement branded types for IDs ✓
3. Replace critical `any` types in error handling and MCP tools ✓ (partially)
4. Add return types to service layer methods
5. Implement database type safety with runtime validation ✓ (partially)

## Phase 6.8: ESLint Error Resolution (2025-07-27)

### Initial State
- **Total ESLint Errors:** 3778 (including 3159 TypeScript-related)
- **Prettier Errors:** 416
- **Major Error Categories:**
  - @typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-member-access: 915
  - @typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-assignment: 427
  - @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any: 337
  - @typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-argument: 193
  - @typescript-eslint/explicit-function-return-type: 94

### Actions Taken
1. **Prettier Formatting:** Fixed 416 formatting errors automatically
2. **Scripts Directory:** Fixed all TypeScript errors in migrate.ts and seed.ts
   - Added proper types to Commander.js action handlers
   - Removed unused logger imports
   - Fixed unsafe member access on options objects
3. **CLI Client:** Started fixing type safety issues
   - Replaced unsafe any returns with proper type assertions
   - Fixed JSON parsing type safety

### Current Status
- **Remaining Errors:** ~3377 (down from 3778)
- **Progress:** ~401 errors fixed (10.6%)
- **Scripts Directory:** ✅ 100% clean (0 errors)

### Strategic Approach Needed
Given the large number of errors (3377), a more systematic approach is required:
1. **Priority 1:** Fix critical type safety issues (unsafe operations)
2. **Priority 2:** Add missing return types to functions
3. **Priority 3:** Replace remaining any types
4. **Priority 4:** Fix console.log statements in non-CLI code
5. **Priority 5:** Fix other TypeScript strict mode issues

### Recommendation
The current approach of fixing files one-by-one is too slow. Need to:
1. Create automated fixes for common patterns
2. Use ESLint auto-fix where possible
3. Focus on high-impact fixes first
4. Consider temporarily relaxing some rules if blocking production

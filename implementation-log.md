## Current Session Progress

### TaskService Test Implementation (In Progress)
**Status**: 🔄 Blocked by database schema mismatch
**Files Created**: 
- `/tests/unit/services/TaskService.test.ts` (38 test cases, properly ordered)
- `/tests/unit/services/TaskService.simple.test.ts` (debugging)

**Issue Identified**: 
- Tests failing with "table tasks has no column named status"
- Migration defines status column correctly
- Database schema not created properly during test initialization
- 100+ TypeScript build errors blocking further investigation

**Test Structure Created**:
1. Task Creation (Foundation) - 6 tests
2. Task Retrieval (Basic Operations) - 7 tests  
3. Task Updates (Lifecycle Management) - 6 tests
4. Task Positioning (Organization) - 1 test
5. Subtask Management (Hierarchical Structure) - 3 tests
6. Task Dependencies (Workflow Management) - 5 tests
7. Task Search (Advanced Queries) - 4 tests
8. Task Deletion (Cleanup) - 3 tests
9. Error Handling & Edge Cases - 3 tests

**Next Actions Required**:
1. Fix TypeScript build errors (100+ across services/routes)
2. Debug database schema initialization in tests
3. Ensure migrations execute properly in test environment
4. Complete TaskService test implementation
| **TOTAL** | **387+** | **197** | **0** | **190+** | **51%** |

## Next Actions

### IMMEDIATE (This Session)
1. **🔴 CRITICAL: Core Service Testing** 
   - **TaskService.ts** (1,006 lines) - 0% coverage
   - **BoardService.ts** (586 lines) - 0% coverage  
   - **ContextService.ts** (1,038 lines) - 0% coverage
   - **Target**: Achieve 80% coverage on business logic

2. **🔴 CRITICAL: REST API Testing**
   - **Task endpoints** (340 lines) - 0% coverage
   - **Board endpoints** (305 lines) - 0% coverage
   - **Target**: Test all CRUD operations and error handling

3. **🔴 CRITICAL: Test Infrastructure**
   - Add test data factories
   - Implement test database isolation
   - Create test utilities for common patterns

### NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES
4. **🟡 MCP Server Testing** - Test AI tools and resources functionality
5. **🟡 WebSocket Testing** - Test real-time event system
6. **🟢 CLI Development** - Begin command implementation with tested foundation
7. **🟢 Integration Testing** - End-to-end workflow validation

## Risk Assessment

### HIGH RISK ⚠️
- **Zero test coverage** on core business logic exposes system to regression bugs
- **Production deployment** without tests is extremely risky
- **Refactoring difficulty** increases without safety net

### MITIGATION STRATEGY
1. **Immediate halt** on new feature development
2. **Focus exclusively** on test coverage until 80% achieved
3. **Establish test-driven** approach for remaining development
4. **Code freeze** except for bug fixes until testing complete

## Success Metrics

### Current State
- **Overall Project**: 51% complete (197/387+ tasks)
- **Test Coverage**: 14.76% (TARGET: 80%)
- **Core Platform**: 100% functional
- **Production Readiness**: 🔴 Not ready due to testing gap

### Success Criteria for Next Session
- **Test Coverage**: Achieve 50%+ on core services
- **Critical Tests**: 100% coverage on TaskService create/update/delete
- **Test Infrastructure**: Fully operational with isolation and factories
- **Foundation**: Solid testing base for remaining development
